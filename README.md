This desktop application was developed with the intention of assisting individuals who extensively utilize headphones for various purposes. It addresses the common issue of losing track of time while engaged with the computer, potentially leading to overexposure and subsequent harm to hearing. Its primary function is to alert users to take breaks from headphone usage to mitigate potential damage.

Key features of the application include volume monitoring to prevent exceeding harmful levels, automated transition to speaker output upon headphone usage expiration, among others. The software is programmed in Python 3.6 and utilizes the PyQt5 toolkit for interface design. Additionally, it incorporates VolumeSoundView, a tool developed by Nirsoft.

This app was created for Nationala InfoEducatie 2020 in just three days.
